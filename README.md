# CraftMine

CraftMine was started as an experiment in **the whole process** of designing a complex system, and Rust was the natural choice.

Its main goals are to:
- Fully utilize modern hardware using concurrency and parallelism
- Have reasonable, compatible defaults while retaining high customizability
- Be feature-compatible, not bug-compatible
- Turn design documentation into code, not the other way around

# Implemented
- **Network protocol**
- Configuration
- Login
- Server browser page
- Debug info

# Version

Vanilla 1.15.2, an old version, is targeted as a baseline. Updates won't be frequent as protocol updates are extremely time-consuming.
